# Usage
There are two versions of the code, Arduiono C and Micropython. The Arduino C model can be installed through the Adruino IDE bby flashing the code to a pico which supports Aduino C. The micropython version can be installed through the VSCode IDE https://code.visualstudio.com or the  Thonny Ide https://thonny.org. Either of these IDEs will work fine. Build theh circuit according to the [schematic](schematic.png). The program can then be run in the same manner as you would run any other program on a pico. Build the remaining parts of the robot, attatch a remote power supply, and run the program.
